# Emotion Analysis of Students using CNN VGG-16
## Introduction 

Facial expression is one of the most important features of human emotion recognition. It was introduced as a research field by Darwin in his book *“The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals”*. 

It can be defined as the facial changes in response to a person’s internal emotional state, intentions, or social communication. Nowadays, automated facial expression recognition has a large variety of applications, such as data-driven animation, neuromarketing, interactive games, sociable robotics and many other human-computer interaction systems. An face emotion recognition system comprises of two step process i.e. face detection (bounded face) in image followed by emotion detection on the detected bounded face. The following two techniques are used for respective mentioned tasks in face recognition system.

**Haar feature-based cascade classifiers:** It detects frontal face in an image well. It is real time and faster in comparison to other face detector. This blog-post uses an implementation from Open-CV.
